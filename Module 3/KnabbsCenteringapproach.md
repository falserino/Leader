## Centering Prayer

Centering Prayer is a form of **contemplative prayer** that focuses on the experience of God. It emphasizes:

- **Silence and Stillness**: Unlike vocal prayers or active meditation, centering prayer involves sitting in **silence**, creating space for God to work within us.
- **Consenting to God**: In centering prayer, we **consent** to God’s presence and action within us, allowing God to work without our constant mental chatter.
- **Letting Go**: We release our need to control and simply rest in God’s presence.
- **No Agenda**: Centering prayer has no specific goals; it’s about being present with God.
- **Heart-Centered**: It’s less about intellectual understanding and more about experiencing God’s love deep within.

## Meditation

Meditation (such as mindfulness or Christian meditation) differs:

- **Focus**: Meditation actively engages the mind. Examples include:
  - **Mindfulness Meditation**: Observing thoughts and sensations without judgment.
  - **Loving-Kindness Meditation**: Cultivating compassion.
  - **Christian Meditation**: Reflecting on scripture.
- **Purpose**: Meditation often has specific purposes (stress reduction, self-awareness, etc.).
- **Active vs. Receptive**: Meditation is more **active**, while centering prayer is **receptive**.
- **Variety**: Different traditions have unique meditation practices.
