# Essence of Servant Leadership: Greenleaf and Yukl

## Robert K. Greenleaf's Perspective

### The Servant as Leader

In his seminal essay "The Servant as Leader," Robert K. Greenleaf introduced the concept of **Servant Leadership**. Here are the key points:

1. **Servant First**: Greenleaf emphasized that a true leader begins as a **servant first**. This innate desire to serve others sets the foundation. It's not about seeking power or material possessions; it's about genuinely wanting to serve.

2. **Conscious Choice**: The journey from servant to leader involves **conscious choice**. A servant-leader aspires to lead, but their motivation remains rooted in service. This contrasts with leaders driven primarily by personal gain.

3. **Caring for Others**: The hallmark of servant leadership lies in **caring for people**. The ultimate test is whether those served **grow as individuals**. Do they become healthier, wiser, freer, and more autonomous? Additionally, servant-leaders consider the impact on the **least privileged** in society.

4. **Shared Power**: Unlike traditional top-down leadership, servant-leaders **share power**. They prioritize the well-being of others and help them develop to their fullest potential.

### Organizations as Servant-Leaders

Greenleaf extended this philosophy to organizations. He believed that institutions could also embody servant-leadership. In his essay "The Institution as Servant," he advocated for caring institutions that serve people, both within and outside their walls.

## Gary Yukl's Perspective

Gary Yukl, in his research on leadership, acknowledges the essence of servant leadership:

1. **Relationship-Centered**: Servant leadership repositions leadership as a **process of relationship**. It's not just about actions but about the **mutual influence** between leader and follower.

2. **Mutual Influence**: Servant-leaders recognize that influence flows both ways. They listen, empathize, and collaborate. Their focus is on building strong relationships.

3. **Empowering Others**: Rather than hoarding power, servant-leaders empower their team members. They create an environment where everyone can contribute and thrive.

## Conclusion

In summary, servant leadership prioritizes **service**, **caring**, and **shared influence**. It challenges traditional power dynamics and fosters environments where people flourish. As we embrace this philosophy, we contribute to a more compassionate and effective world. While Yukl's and Greenleaf's perspectives may differ in some ways, the concepts form a pattern that shows leadership through mutual influence, caring and following the teachings of Christ as noted in:

***The Greatest Commandment*** pericope

> 34 Hearing that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, the Pharisees got together. 35 One of them, an expert in the law, tested him with this question: 36 “Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the Law?”

37 Jesus replied: “‘Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’ 38 This is the first and greatest commandment. 39 And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ 40 All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.”

This also re-inforces the notion of **empowering others**, which is simply giving them permission to do what is necessary and to support them as needed and the ability to treat each other with mutual repsect and dignity. A leader will be what's often called an 'Active Listener' noting that it's not always an answer the person in need is looking for, but rather, they're just looking for someone to talk to.

As a leader, I think it's important that although you may be a listener in **active listening**, I think that you should be thoughtful and speak prayerfully with God or your minister as you discuss matterss that trouble you. You want to ensure that your directs that are under your care, have the greatest confidence that you are steadfast and firm. In that same vein, I think it's not bad that your staff understand that you may speak with your priest regularly as it sets the example for them as well.
