# Essence of Servant Leadership: Greenleaf and Yukl

## Robert K. Greenleaf's Perspective

### The Servant as Leader

In his seminal essay "The Servant as Leader," Robert K. Greenleaf introduced the concept of **Servant Leadership**. Here are the key points:

1. **Servant First**: Greenleaf emphasized that a true leader begins as a **servant first**. This innate desire to serve others sets the foundation. It's not about seeking power or material possessions; it's about genuinely wanting to serve.

2. **Conscious Choice**: The journey from servant to leader involves **conscious choice**. A servant-leader aspires to lead, but their motivation remains rooted in service. This contrasts with leaders driven primarily by personal gain.

3. **Caring for Others**: The hallmark of servant leadership lies in **caring for people**. The ultimate test is whether those served **grow as individuals**. Do they become healthier, wiser, freer, and more autonomous? Additionally, servant-leaders consider the impact on the **least privileged** in society.

4. **Shared Power**: Unlike traditional top-down leadership, servant-leaders **share power**. They prioritize the well-being of others and help them develop to their fullest potential.
