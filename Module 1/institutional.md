### Organizations as Servant-Leaders

Greenleaf extended this philosophy to organizations. He believed that institutions could also embody servant-leadership. In his essay "The Institution as Servant," he advocated for caring institutions that serve people, both within and outside their walls.

## Gary Yukl's Perspective

Gary Yukl, in his research on leadership, acknowledges the essence of servant leadership:

1. **Relationship-Centered**: Servant leadership repositions leadership as a **process of relationship**. It's not just about actions but about the **mutual influence** between leader and follower.

2. **Mutual Influence**: Servant-leaders recognize that influence flows both ways. They listen, empathize, and collaborate. Their focus is on building strong relationships.

3. **Empowering Others**: Rather than hoarding power, servant-leaders empower their team members. They create an environment where everyone can contribute and thrive.
