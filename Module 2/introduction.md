# Robert Greenleaf's Servant Leadership and Trustees as Servants

Robert K. Greenleaf's concept of servant leadership revolutionizes the traditional power hierarchy, suggesting leaders should prioritize serving others. His essay "Trustees as Servants" applies this philosophy to trustees in organizations.

## Trustees as Servant Leaders
Trustees should act as servant leaders, focusing on serving the organization, its employees, and stakeholders, rather than wielding power. They are responsible for ensuring the organization adheres to its mission and values and serves society's greater good.

## Conclusion
In essence, Greenleaf's work is a call to action for trustees to lead with service, inspire change, and safeguard their institutions' integrity and purpose.
