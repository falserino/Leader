## Kotter and the early church

starting from the Resurrection of Christ. As we stated earlier and can compare the teachings in the Gospels to the writings of men, much later in our history. We are merely consolidating and describing the actions of Biblical principles. For example, Kotter is well known for his eight-stage process for effectively implementing change within organizations. However, looking a little more closely, we can see that Kotter and others utilized the teachings of Christ and the growth of the early Christian church.

### 1. Create a Sense of Urgency

**- Early Church:** After Jesus’ resurrection, He commissioned His disciples to spread the Gospel to all nations (Matthew 28:19-20). Urgency was clear: souls were at stake.

**- Kotter:** Urgency is essential for change. In John 18:1-2, Jesus goes to the Garden of Gethsemane with His disciples, knowing that His hour has come.

### 2. Build a Guiding Coalition

**- Early Church:** The apostles formed a committed group to lead the movement (Acts 6:1-7). Unity was crucial.

**- Kotter:** A coalition of influential leaders ensures alignment. Jesus’ prayer for unity in John 17:20-23 exemplifies this.

### 3. Develop a Vision and Strategy

**- Early Church:** The vision was clear—to spread the Gospel (Acts 1:8). Strategies included preaching, miracles, and community (Acts 2:42-47).

**- Kotter:** Vision matters. Proverbs 29:18 says, “Where there is no vision, the people perish.”

### 4. Communicate the Vision

**- Early Church:** Peter boldly preached the vision (Acts 2:14-41). Communication was vital.

**- Kotter:** Over-communicate! Romans 10:17 reminds us that faith comes by hearing.

### 5. Empower Broad-Based Action

**- Early Church:** All believers were active contributors (Acts 4:32-35). Empowerment was key.

**- Kotter:** Empowerment drives change. Ephesians 4:11-12 highlights equipping the saints for ministry.

### 6. Generate Short-Term Wins

**- Early Church:** Healing the lame man (Acts 3:1-10) and conversions (Acts 8:5-8) were early wins.

**- Kotter:** Celebrate progress! Luke 15:7 says there’s joy in heaven over one sinner who repents.

### 7. Sustain Acceleration

**- Early Church:** The church persisted despite persecution (Acts 8:1-4). Relentless pursuit!

**- Kotter:** Keep pressing forward. Philippians 3:14 encourages us to press toward the goal.

### 8. Anchor Change in Culture

**- Early Church:** The church’s culture reflected love, sharing, and devotion (Acts 2:42-47).

**- Kotter:** Culture matters. Romans 12:2 urges transformation by renewing our minds.

In summary, the early church exemplified Kotter’s principles long before they were articulated. Their leadership and unwavering commitment, vision, and reliance on God’s guidance fueled exponential growth. Following this pattern of the early church has been a foundational element for many startups that were created in garages or basements and although they aren't seen in their biblical context, it was this initial push of Christianity and its sustainability that has been a model for over two millennia!
