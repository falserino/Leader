## A Quick word on Leadership and Promotions from a Christian Perspective

Just as we watch and admire certain characteristics of leaders, colleagues, and friends and tend to model ourselves using these traits, so too, are others watching us. So regardless of station, Christian leaders must always be ethical and authentic, to live by the teachings of Christ and when we make mistakes, we “own” them, ask for forgiveness, and make amends in an ethical manner.

From a leadership and career standpoint, each Christian leader should already be acting as if they are auditioning and playing the next role, they would like to be in. For Example, when a senior employee wants to become a supervisor, they should be asking for additional responsibilities and managing their time properly including arriving early and staying later in order to learn how to do the role of supervisor and even asking a supervisor to mentor them. During the promotion and rewards season they can then have evidence and even a potential recommendation on being elevated to the level when a role opens up. We should also be cognizant that as we see in Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV)"11 For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future."

We cannot rush the will of God, nor should we be impatient. We are where we need to be in order to serve His will, and as Christians, we should always be mindful of this. It's hard sometimes to labor while others seem to move forward, but as Christ said in both Luke 9:23 (NIV) "23 Then he said to them all: “Whoever wants to be my disciple must deny themselves and take up their cross daily and follow me.", Likewise we see the same words from Jesus in the books of Matthew, John, and the Apostle Paul in Galatians. We should always have thoughtful prayer as we learned earlier and speak with the Lord on all matters, he has a purpose for each one of us and his Will be done.
