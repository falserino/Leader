# Learning Objectives

Tying it all together. Over the last 7 sessions we have covered a variety of popular leadership topics based on authentic and ethical leadership theories. We have also addressed areas where there are more than simply coincidences of leadership theories and Scripture. We are and always will be tied to the Living God, regardless of how far a man tries to run, he cannot escape God.

In this module, you will learn how to integrate the skills and knowledge you have acquired in the previous modules. You will learn how to apply the concepts of team building, decision making, and leading change to real-life scenarios. You will also learn how to reflect on your own strengths and areas for improvement as a leader. You will practice using different tools and frameworks to help you enhance your leadership effectiveness. By completing this module, you will be able to:

- Identify and apply the key elements of creating and leading a successful team
- Use a systematic process to make ethical and effective decisions
- Develop and implement a strategy for leading positive change
- Evaluate your own leadership style and performance
- Seek and incorporate feedback for continuous improvement
