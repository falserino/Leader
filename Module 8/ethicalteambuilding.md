# Ethical Leadership and Team Building

A successful leader knows how to build and lead a successful team. A successful team is a cohesive group of people working towards a common goal. The key elements of creating and leading a successful team include having a clear team vision, strong communication, clearly defined roles, and shared values and expectations.

## A Life Well Lived

A good leader must be able to make ethical and practical decisions. A systematic process should be used that involves identifying the problem, gathering information, considering the options, and making sound and ethical decisions that benefit the organization without compromising the principles of the team members. It is essential to consider the decision’s impact on stakeholders and apply ethical principles to guide decision-making, which includes extending beyond work settings. As Christian leaders, our actions are always observed and, in many cases, influence and impact the lives of others, even if we’re not actively engaged with them. We are influencers with one sponsor, God.
